Practice creating new repo

Already there's a different feel. I miss business school. I miss data analytics. This program I am in now and the data science immersive that I am trying to get in to, it's a challenge yes. It's something I can work towards, yes. But is the work really something I love? What about the environment? These are all factors I need to consider. 

How frustrating.
